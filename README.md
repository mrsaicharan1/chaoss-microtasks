This repository consists of the microtasks stated for the project: Implement Gitlab Data Collection Workers

- [X] **Microtask 0:** Familiarize yourself with augur by downloading and setting it up locally, get a basic understanding of Augur's architecture, how the housekeeper, broker & workers carry out tasks from the queue and how the data collection workers mine data from various sources.

- [X] **Microtask 1 & 2:** Wrote a python script which pulls data from the Gitlab API in JSON form and saves it.  Worked under the dev branch. Sent a Pull request to the dev branch in which I created a directory named `mrsaicharan1` under the `workers/` directory. Also uploaded the JSON file generated by the python script
